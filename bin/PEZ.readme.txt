HOW TO USE MY PEZ DISPENSER PROGRAM:
   -To get a demo of every required method used, simply run the main method in 	main method in Main.java.
	ORDER: Print(), Pop(), Push([int]), ReversePrint(), Sum([Dispenser].getHead(), [Dispenser].getCount()).

   -To push your own number instead of (or before/after) 3, either modify the
	int topush in Main.java's main or add a line with d.Push([int]);

   -As explained in code's comments: I used a bound of 100 for the random number generation to prevent 
	the program from hanging. You can remove that bound if desired.

Enjoy your delicious random number candy!
